            My name is <span class="bio-name">Joshua Dias</span>, and I was born
            on December 14, 1995. In 2020, I successfully completed my Bachelor
            of Science in Mathematics at Corban University in Salem, Oregon.
            Inspired by my academic background, I made the decision to venture
            into the field of Web Development. Since then, I have been actively
            engaging in online courses to enhance my proficiency in both
            front-end and back-end programming languages. I am currently seeking
            employment opportunities that provide a platform for me to
            contribute to a dynamic team. I am enthusiastic about the prospect
            of utilizing my knowledge and skills in a professional setting.

            corresponding hex and RGB values. Additionally, it presents various
            fonts with their respective font styles, and provides text style
            examples for the p, h1, and h2 elements.

            This project demonstrates my proficiency in JavaScript. The main
            focus of the project revolves around the
            <span class="code">validateCred()</span> function, which takes an
            input array containing credit card numbers and applies the criteria
            for credit card validation. It accurately determines whether a
            credit card number is valid or not, and returns a boolean value as
            output. Additionally, the
            <span class="code">findInvalidCards()</span> function plays a
            crucial role by iterating through a nested array of credit card
            numbers. It utilizes the
            <span class="code">validateCred()</span> function to identify and
            extract the invalid credit card numbers, storing them in a new
            nested array that is subsequently returned.<br /><br /><img

            server-side, and uses a MySQL database. As a gym rat myself, I
            created this app to provide a convenient way to track workout
            progress and stay motivated. Once registering and logging in, you
            can estimate your calorie intake and expenditure. The dashboard is
            where most of the content is located. Here, you can update your
            weight, create and manage personalized workout routines, and track
            progress for individual exercises. Whether you're a fitness

            ><br /><br />
            This is a card game implemented in Python and played in the
            terminal. Each card in the game has three attributes: type, number,
            and color.<br /><br />
            Types: Fire, Ice, Water<br />
            Numbers: 5-12<br />
            Colors: Red, Green, Yellow, Blue<br /><br />
            At the beginning of the game, the deck is shuffled and divided
            equally between the player and the computer. In each round, the
            player is presented with a selection of three cards to choose from,
            while the computer also plays a card.<br /><br />
            <img
              src="Projects/Card Game/1.png"
              alt="Card Game Image"
              width="100%PP"
            /><br /><br />
            The comparison process starts by comparing the types of the cards.
            Fire beats Ice, Ice beats Water, and Water beats Fire. If the types
            are the same, the numbers on the cards are compared, with the higher
            number winning. In the case of a tie in both type and number, the
            round ends without a winner. Each round, the winning card is saved
            for the winner.<br /><br />

              alt="Card Game Image"
              width="100%PP"
            /><br /><br />
            To win the game, a player must collect a specific set of three
            cards. The winning set is determined by both the type and color. The
            player must have either three cards of the same type or one card of
            each type, with distinct colors.<br /><br />

            This project is an app built using Python's Django framework. While
            the design maintains simplicity, the primary focus was on
            functionality. The website serves as a restaurant inventory
            management simulation. It enables users to track inventory stock,
            expenses, revenue, and profit as purchases are made. Upon visiting
            the homepage, you will find limited content until you register and
            log in. Once authenticated, you gain access to the various models.
            Each page allows you to add, update, or delete items as necessary.
            The inventory page facilitates the addition of items, their unit
            prices, and current stock levels. Similarly, the menu page allows
            the addition of menu items along with their respective prices.
            Furthermore, you can conveniently update the recipes for each menu
            item. When a customer makes a purchase, the purchase page records
            the transaction. In doing so, the inventory items used in the recipe
            are automatically deducted from the stock on the inventory page. As
            an overview, the report page tracks revenue from the purchases model
            and expenses from the inventory model. By subtracting the two, it
            presents the total profit generated.
